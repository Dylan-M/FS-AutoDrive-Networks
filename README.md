## License
All networks in this repository are licensed under the [CC0 1.0 Universal license](LICENSE).

# How to use.
Download the AutoDrive_config.xml file for the map into the save game folder for whichever save you wish.
WARNING: Following this **will** overwrite any existing courses for that save game. If you wish to keep them, please create a backup.

## I found a bug, limitation, or other issue with a network
Please use the [GitHub Issues tool](https://github.com/Dylan-M/FS-AutoDrive-Networks/issues) for this repository.

# Translations
I will not be translating any of the networks in this repository. If you wish to submit a translation, please fork this repository, created a dedicated branch, make your changes, and open a pull request to this repository. The pull request **must** be from a dedicated branch just for that change, not from the main/master branch of your fork. Please see the [GitFlow Document](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
To use a translated file, simply rename the existing AutoDrive_config.xml to AutoDrive_config_en.xml before renaming the translated file to AutoDrive_config.xml. For example, to use the German (Deutsch) translation, you would rename AutoDrive_config_de.xml to AutoDrive_config.xml.

### .md File translations
If you contribute a translation to any of the .md files, they should be named with the 2 character country code as well. Such as: README_de.md or CONTRIBUTING_de.md and then linked from the document that they're a translation of.

# How to contribute
As with translations, the basic procedure to follow is to fork, branch, make changes, create a PR. Follow this [GitFlow Document](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). More detailed instructions can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# How much does this cost me?
Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

# Can I create a network for you on map XYZ?
Maybe. Perhaps. My time is valuable. I will accept paid contracts to make networks. What we negotiate would depend on the complexity and size of the map. The network would remain mine, be licensed under the [CC0 1.0 Universal license](LICENSE) with the rest of this repository, and shared with everyone. Otherwise, you can hope that I decide to play the same map and create a network for it.

## Additional Resources
There are others doing similar things. I fork their repos as I come across them, so that I can contribute fixes. These are links to those.
