# Network Description
Most fields are unidirectional tracks, but a few are omnidirectional. Almost all unload/sale points are unidirectional because of how AutoDrive works with them for automatic unloading.

Caveats:
1. Designed for (and using to map the routes) a short wheelbase semi (articulated lorry for you Brits out there). I used the one from the MAZ pack from fs19.net for example. I believe it is a single axle tractor and approximately 35' single axle trailer.
2. Taller equipment may have issues with leaning trees over the mapped tracks. I advise just removing and selling the trees!
3. I designed this to my specifications, for my playthrough. If you disagree with my choices, you may say so if you are respectful. Rudeness will not be tolerated.
4. I built this on New Farmer, but for my own use on Start From Scratch. Should thus be compatible with all 3 game modes.
